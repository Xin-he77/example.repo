I'm an R Markdown document!

# section 1
here is section 1

tgis is a new line

##subsections 1.1
 here is a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2
I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

```{r}
mean(samp)
plot_df = tibble(
x = rnorm(1000, sd = .5),
y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(1000)
)
```

the number of rows in plot_df is r nrow(plot_df)

The chunk below creates a dataframe containing a sample of size 500 from a 
random normal variable and the absolute value of each element of that sample, 
and produces a histogram of the absolute value.

```{r learning_assessment_1}
library(tidyverse)

la_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(500),
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
  abs_norm_samp = abs(norm_samp)
)

ggplot(la_df, aes(x = abs_norm_samp)) + geom_histogram()

median_samp = median(pull(la_df, norm_samp))
```

The median of the variable containing absolute values is 
`r round(median_samp, digits = 2)`.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
